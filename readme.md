## Things to know
### Templating
* Cards from the List are formatted in a way that the collector number is SET-NUM. Check Scryfall if not sure
* Foiling options currently only support nonfoil, foil, and etched, all case-sensetive (I think)
* Be sure to check the Scryfall for promos, they may be different than what is shown on the card (i.e. Secluded Starforge pre-release promo is actually 257s PEOE instead of just 257 EOE)
